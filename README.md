# RaidStart - Get raids started quickly

This simple addon is designed to start raid groups quickly. Features:

* Show a list of your raid roster, along with their status - in group, ready for invite, invited, offline
* Simple button to invite members
* Auto-convert to raid
* Hide it when you're done setting up the group


## Caveats / TODOs

* Only works for guild members
* Member list is hardcoded
* No auto-promotion to raid assist yet
* Says nothing if you're not the leader or can't invite
* Doesn't deal with people being on alts at all
* Not a final UI yet (looks like ass)
